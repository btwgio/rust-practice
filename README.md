# rust-practice

This repository is dedicated to my Rust studies ðŸ¦€  
Youâ€™ll find small projects, tests, and exercises as I explore the language.

The focus is on hands-on learning, with simple code and experimentation.

I'm mainly following the official Rust documentation:

- ðŸ“š https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/

## Included studies

- `guessing`: a number guessing game via terminal (CLI).  
Inspired by the project from _The Rust Programming Language_ book
(https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html)
